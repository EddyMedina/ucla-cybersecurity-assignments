# Archiving and Logging Data Homework
---

### `tar`: Create, extract, compress, and manage tar backup archives

Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:

```bash
tar xvf TarDocs.tar
```

Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directroy:

```bash
tar cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude "Documents/Java" Documents/
```

Ensuring `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:

```bash
tar tvvf Javaless_Docs.tar| grep -i java
```

**Bonus:** Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory.

```bash
sudo tar cvvWf logs_backup.tar.gz --listed-incremental=snapshot.file --level 0 /log
```

#### `tar` Critical Thinking

Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same with `tar`?

Because '-c' means create a tar archive and '-x' means to execute it so they're contradicting.

### `cron`: Create, manage and automate various cron jobs

Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:

```bash
0 6 * * 3 tar cvzf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log
```

---

### `bash scripting`: Write basic bash scripts

Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/backups/{freemen,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}
```

Command and file edit to create `system.sh` (you can copy and paste it here):

```bash
touch system.sh && nano system.sh
```

- Within the script, have the following:

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    free -h >> /var/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
    du -h >> /var/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
    lsof >> /var/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
    df -h >> /var/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
```

Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:

```bash
chmod u+x system.sh
```

Commands to to confirm script's execution:

```bash
cat /var/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

cat /var/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

cat /var/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

cat /var/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
```

Command to copy `system.sh` to system-wide cron directory:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
@weekly /home/sysadmin/system.sh
```

---

### `journalctl`: Perform various log filtering techniques

Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

```bash
journalctl -p "emerg".."err" -b -0
```

Command to return `systemd-journald` messages:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u systemd-journald -b -0
```

Comand to prune archived journal files except the most recent 2:

```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-files=2
```

**Bonus** Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between 0 and 2, output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`

```bash
journalctl -p 0..2 >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
```

**Bonus 2** Command and file edit to automate the last command in a daily cronjob:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

- Within the `crontab` file, add the following:

```bash
@daily sudo journalctl -p 0..2 >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt
```

---

### `rsyslog`: Priority based log file creation

Command and file edit to record all `mail` log messages, except for `debug` to `/var/log/mail.log`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
```

- Add within the configuration file:

```bash
mail.!debug         -/var/log/mail.log
```

Command and file edit to record all `boot` log messages, except for `info` and `debug` to `/var/log/boot.log`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
```

- Add within the configuration file:

```bash
local7.!info,!debug     /var/log/boot.log
```

---

### `logrotate`: Manage log file sizes

Command and file edit that backs up authentication messages to `/var/log/auth.log`:

- Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file.

- Add within the configuration file:

```bash
    /var/log/auth.log {
        missingok
        weekly
        rotate 7
        notifempty
        delaycompress
        endscript
    }
```

---

### BONUS ACTIVITY `auditd`: Check for policy and file violations.

Command to verify `auditd` is active:

```bash
systemctl status auditd
```

Command and file edit to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/audit/auditd.conf
```

- Add within the configuration file:

```bash
    num_logs = 7
    max_log_file = 35
```

Command and file edit using `auditd` itself to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
```

- Add within the `rules` file:

```bash
    -w /etc/shadow -p raw -k hashpass_audit
    -w /etc/passwd -p rwa -k userpass_audit
    -w /var/log/auth.log -p rwa -k authlog_audit    
```

Command to restart `auditd`:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart auditd
```

Command to list all `auditd` rules:

```bash
sudo auditctl -l
```

Command to produce an audit report:

```bash
sudo aureport -au    #for user authentications
sudo aureport -m     #for modifications
```

Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

```bash
sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron
```

Command to re-verify `auditd` rules:

```bash
sudo auditctl -l
-w /var/log/cron -p rwxa   #verified that input was correct
```
