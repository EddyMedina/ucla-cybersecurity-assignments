# Network Security
## Part 1
### Security Control Types

With the understanding that Defense in Depth can be broken down into three different security control types, answer the following questions:

- Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?
    Answer: **Physical control**

- Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?
    Answer: **Administrative control**

- Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?
    Answer: **Technical control**

### Intrusion Detection and Attack indicators
- What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?
    Answer: **An IDS physically connects via a network tap or mirrored port or SPAN, whereas physically connects inline with the flow of data is typically placed in between the firewall and network switch.**

- What's the difference between an Indicator of Attack and an Indicator of Compromise?
   Answer: **An IOA happens in real time and is more proactive. An IOC has a more reactive approach and indicates previous malicious activity.**

#### The Cyber Kill Chain

Name each of the seven stages for the Cyber Kill chain and provide a brief example of each.

- Stage 1: **Reconnaissance** - Jumping on a social media platform like Facebook or Twitter to gather information.
- Stage 2: **Weaponization** - Establishing attack vectors and technical profiles of targets like logical and administrative security controls.
- Stage 3: **Delivery** - email, USB, a website.
- Stage 4: **Exploitation** - using social engineering.
- Stage 5: **Installation** - malicious software installations or cron jobs.
- Stage 6: **Command and Control** - an internet relay chat to control a victim's computer
- Stage 7: **Actions on Objectives** - Hands-on keyboard access to accomplish goal

### Snort Rule Analysis

Use the Snort rule to answer the following questions:

**Snort Rule #1**
```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 5800:5820 (msg:"ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820"; flags:S,12; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/2002910; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:2002910; rev:5; metadata:created_at 2010_07_30, updated_at 2010_07_30;)
```

Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.
Answer: 
- **alert** - an alert was triggered
- **tcp** - applies the rule to all tcp packets
- **$EXTERNAL_NET**  - applies to packets coming from the external network
- **any** - applies to packets from any port
- **$HOME_NET** - the destination address
- **5800:5820** - destination source port

What stage of the Cyber Kill Chain does this alert violate?
   Answer: **Stage 1 - Reconnaissance**

What kind of attack is indicated?
   Answer: **ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820 attack. - it's an attempted recon attack.**

**Snort Rule #2**
```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP"; flow:established,to_client; flowbits:isnotset,ET.http.binary; flowbits:isnotset,ET.INFO.WindowsUpdate; file_data; content:"MZ"; within:2; byte_jump:4,58,relative,little; content:"PE|00 00|"; distance:-64; within:4; flowbits:set,ET.http.binary; metadata: former_category POLICY; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/2018959; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2018959; rev:4; metadata:created_at 2014_08_19, updated_at 2017_02_01;)
```

Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.
   Answer:
- **alert** - an alert was triggered
- **tcp** - applies the rule to all tcp packets
- **$EXTERNAL_NET** - applies to packets coming from the external network
- **$HTTP_PORTS** - applies to packets coming http ports
- **$HOME_NET** - the destination address is the home network
- **any** - any destination port

What layer of the Defense in Depth model does this alert violate?
   Answer: **Policies, Procedures, and Awareness Layer**

What kind of attack is indicated?
   Answer: **ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP attack - it's a violation attack.**

**Snort Rule #3**
- Your turn! Write a Snort rule that alerts when traffic is detected inbound on port 4444 to the local network on any port. Be sure to include the `msg` in the Rule Option.
    Answer: **alert tcp any 4444 -> $LOCAL_NET any (msg:"Traffic detected inbound on port 4444 to local network on any port")**

### Lab: "Drop Zone"

#### Log into the Azure `firewalld` machine
Log in using the following credentials:
- Username: `sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`
#### Uninstall `ufw`

Before you get started, it's generally best practice to ensure that you do not have any instances of `ufw` running in order to avoid conflicts with your `firewalld` service. Additionally, this ensures that `firewalld` will be your default firewall.

- Run the command that removes any running instance of `ufw`.
```bash
    $ sudo ufw disable
    $ sudo ufw reset
```

#### Enable and start `firewalld`
By default, these service should be running. If not, then run the following commands:
- Run the commands that enables and starts `firewalld` upon boots and reboots.
```bash
    $ sudo systemctl enable firewalld
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/firewalld start
```
  Note: This will ensure that `firewalld` service remains active after each reboot.

#### Confirm that the service is running.
- Run the command that checks whether or not the `firewalld` service is up and running.
```bash
    $ systemctl status firewalld
```

#### List all firewall rules currently configured.
Next, lists all currently configured firewall rules. This will give you a good idea of what's currently configured and save you time in the long run by not doing double work.
- Run the command that lists all currently configured firewall rules:
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```
- Take note of what Zones and settings are configured. You many need to remove unneeded services and settings.

#### List all supported service types that can be enabled.
- Run the command that lists all currently supported services to see if the service you need is available
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-services
```
 Note: that we can see that the `Home` and `Drop` Zones are created by default.


#### Zone Views
- Run the command that lists all currently configured zones.
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```
- We can see that the `Public` and `Drop` Zones are created by default. Therefore, we will need to create Zones for `Web`, `Sales`, and `Mail`.

#### Create Zones for `Web`, `Sales` and `Mail`.
- Run the commands that creates Web, Sales and Mail zones.
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=web
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=sales
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --new-zone=mail
```

#### Set the zones to their designated interfaces:
- Run the command that sets your `eth0` interface to your zones.
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --change-interface=eth0
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --change-interface=eth0
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --change-interface=eth0
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --change-interface=eth0
```

#### Add services to the active zones:
- Run the commands that add services to the **public** zone, the **Web** zone, the **sales** zone,and the **mail** zone.
- Public:
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=pop3 --permanent
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=smtp --permanent
```

- Web:
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --add-service=http --permanent
```

- Sales
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --add-service=https --permanent
```

- Mail
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --add-service=smtp --permanent
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --add-service=pop3 --permanent
```

- What is the status of `http`, `https`, `smtp` and `pop3`? enabled to the list of the services.

#### Add your adversaries to the Drop Zone.
- Run the command that will add all current and any future blacklisted IPs to the Drop Zone.
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop -add-source=10.208.56.23
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop -add-source=135.95.103.76
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop -add-source=76.34.169.118
```

#### Make rules permanent then reload them:

It's good practice to ensure that your `firewalld` installation remains nailed up and services across reboots. This ensures that the network remains secured after unplanned outages such as, power failures.

- Run the command that reloads the `firewalld` configurations and writes it to memory
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

#### View Active Zones
Now we'll want to provide truncated listings of all currently active zones. This a good point to verify your zone settings.
- Run the command that displays all zone services.
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
```

#### Block an IP address
- Use a rich-rule that blocks the IP address `138.138.0.3`  on your public zone.
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="138.138.0.3" reject'
```

#### Block Ping/ICMP Requests
You've decided to harden your network against `ping` scans by blocking `icmp ehco` replies.

- Run the command that blocks `pings` and `icmp` requests in your `public` zone.
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-icmp-block=echo-reply --add-icmp-block=echo-request
```

#### Rule Check
Now that you've set up your brand new `firewalld` installation, it's time to verify that all of the settings have taken effect.

- Run the command that lists all  of the rule settings. Do one command at a time for each zone.
```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=web --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=sales --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=mail --list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=drop --list-all
```
- Are all of our rules in place? If not, then go back and make the necessary modifications before checking again.

Congratulations! You have successfully configured and deployed a fully comprehensive `firewalld` installation.

### Lab: "Green Eggs & SPAM"

In this activity, you will target spam, discover its whereabouts, and uncover the malicious deeds that the sender is intending.

- You will assume the role of a Jr. Security administrator working for the Department of Technology for the State of California.
- As a junior administrator, your primary role is to perform the initial triage of alert data: the initial investigation and analysis followed by an escalation of high priority alerts to senior incident handlers for further review.
- You will work as part of a Computer and Incident Response Team (CIRT), responsible for producing a **Threat Intelligence Card** as part of your incident report.

#### Threat Intelligence Card
**NOTE** Log into the Security Onion VM and use the following **Indicator of Attack** to complete this portion of the homework. 

Locate the following Indicator of Attack in Sguil based off of the following:

  - **Source IP/Port** 188.124.9.56:80
  - **Destination Address/Port** 192.168.3.35:1035
  - **Event Message** ET TROJAN JS/Nemucod.M.gen downloading EXE payload

Answer the following:
- What was the indicator of an attack in Sguil? **The ST status section is marked red which means that it's in progress, so it triggered an alert.**
  - Hint: Do the packet details tell you anything? 
- What was the adversarial motivation (purpose of attack)?
  - **The downloader is attached to emails in a zip file. When the user opens the email and double-clicks the zip file, it will open Internet Explorer and execute the Javascript and install malware.**
- Describe observations and indicators that may be related to the perpetrators of the intrusion. Categorize your insights according to the appropriate stage of the cyber kill chain, as structured in the following table.

| TTP | Example | Findings |
| **Reconnaissance** |  How did the attacker locate the victim? | They used a campaign to target Italian users and used emails written in Italian. Phishing email.
| **Weaponization** |  What was downloaded?| a PDF file in a zip file that looks like an invoice. Basically an EXE file with malware.
| **Delivery** |    How was it downloaded?| It was sent through email and the user would download it.
| **Exploitation** |  What does the exploit do?| It opens malware as clicking on the zip file triggers the javascript to execute.
| **Installation** | How is the exploit installed?| The JS file downloads an EXE file which runs in the background.
| **Command & Control (C2)** | How does the attacker gain control of the remote machine?| the exe file runs through the ActiveX shell control, which gives the attacker access.
| **Actions on Objectives** | What does the software that the attacker sent do to complete its tasks?| Its goal is to download the software called Gozi infostealer, which starts working once the machine has been rebooted.

For the final part of the homework, complete a set of review questions about firewall architecture and methodologies:
### Firewall Architectures and Methodologies

- Which type of firewall verifies the three-way TCP handshake? TCP handshake checks are designed to ensure that session packets are from legitimate sources.
  Answer: **Circuit-Level Gateway Firewall**

- Which type of firewall considers the connection as a whole? Meaning, instead of looking at only individual packets, these firewalls look at whole streams of packets at one time.
  Answer: **Stateful Firewall**

- Which type of firewall intercepts all traffic prior to being forwarded to its final destination. In a sense, these firewalls act on behalf of the recipient by ensuring the traffic is safe prior to forwarding it?
  Answer: **Application or Proxy Firewalls**

- Which type of firewall examines data within a packet as it progresses through a network interface by examining source and destination IP address, port number, and packet type- all without opening the packet to inspect its contents?
  Answer: **Stateless Firewall/Packet Filter Firewall**

- Which type of firewall filters based solely on source and destination MAC address?
  Answer: **MAC Layer Filtering Firewall**
