# Week 7 - Windows Administration and Hardening

**Deliverable 1:** Submit a note of your reasoning for your account lockout policy.

I created a new GPO under the GPO folder in the Group Policy Management. I decided to go with the 10/15/15 where you can have 10 bad attempts, a 15 minute lockout duration, and counter reset after 15 minutes. This gives the user time (if they forgot their password) to seek help with IT without wasting their day waiting for their account lockout to reset. It can also trigger the sysadmin if attempted logins seems suspicious.

**Deliverable 2**: Submit a screenshot of your Account Lockout Policies in Group Policy Management Editor. It should show the three values you set under the columns, Policy and Policy Setting.
