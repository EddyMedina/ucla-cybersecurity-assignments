### Riddle 3

![Image](https://github.com/criscollazos/ucla-cybersecurity-assignments/blob/master/images/Cryptography15.png)

First, I copied the cipher text onto a text file:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ echo "4qMOIvwEGXzvkMvRE2bNbg==" >> ciphertext_riddle.txt.enc
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ cat ciphertext_riddle.txt.enc 
4qMOIvwEGXzvkMvRE2bNbg==
```

Second, I used **openssl** to decrypt the message using the options given in the riddle:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ sudo openssl enc -pbkdf2 -nosalt -aes-256-cbc -in ciphertext_riddle.txt.enc -d -base64 -K 5284A3B154D99487D9D8D8508461A478C7BEB67081A64AD9A15147906E8E8564 -iv 1907C5E255F7FC9A6B47B0E789847AED

### Riddle 5

![Image](https://github.com/criscollazos/ucla-cybersecurity-assignments/blob/master/images/Cryptography7.png)

First, I copied the hash onto a txt file:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ echo "3b75cdd826a16f5bba0076690f644dc7" >> hash_riddle.txt
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ cat hash_riddle.txt 
3b75cdd826a16f5bba0076690f644dc7
```

Second, I used **hashcat** to crack the hash using md5 as the mode:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o solved_hash.txt hash_riddle.txt rockyou.txt --force
hashcat (v5.1.0) starting...

This enables cracking passwords and salts > length 32 but for the price of drastically reduced performance.

Third, I used "cat" on the solved_hash.txt to see the cracked text:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ cat solved_hash.txt 
3b75cdd826a16f5bba0076690f644dc7:argyle 
```

**Image:**

Based on the riddle, I knew I needed to use Steghide and use "ABC" as the passphrase:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ steghide extract -sf mary-lamb.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "code_is_inside_this_file.txt".
```

The passphrase worked! So I used "cat" to view the code in the file:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ cat code_is_inside_this_file.txt 
mcclane
```

I entered the code and got this answer:
