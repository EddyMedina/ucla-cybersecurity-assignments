### Your Objective 
Utilize your Splunk skills to design a powerful monitoring solution to protect Vandaly from security attacks.

### Topics Covered in This Assignment
- Researching and adding new apps
- Installing new apps
- Uploading files
- Splunk searching
- Using fields
- Custom reports
- Custom alerts

## Vandalay Industries Monitoring Activity Instructions
### Step 1: Monitoring Vandalay's Web Servers

**Background:**  As the worldwide leader of importing and exporting, Vandalay Industries has been the target of many adversaries attempting to disrupt their online business. Recently, Vandaly has been  experiencing DDOS attacks against their web servers.

**Task:** Install and configure a new Splunk App called **Network Toolkit** to monitor Vandaly's web servers `198.153.194.1` and `198.153.194.2`.  As a note, **Network Toolkit**  has many networking capabilities such as ping, traceroute, and speedtests.

- After a successful install, select the new **Network Toolkit**  app from your list of available apps.
- Select **Ping** >> and **Execute Ping** (leave the other fields as they are)
  - Enter in the following hosts one at a time:  `198.153.194.1` and `198.153.194.2` then click **Execute Ping**
- Let the monitoring run and view the **results** page
- Provide a screenshot of the results screen that displays the state of your web servers

**Bonus:** Run the Speedtest and provide a screenshot of those results:

### Step 2: The Need for Speed 

**Background**: Not only were web servers taken offline by a DDOS attack, but upload and download speed were also significantly impacted after the outage. Your networking team provided results of a network speed run around the time of the latest DDOS attack.

**Task:** Create a report to determine the impact that the DDOS attack had on download and upload speed. Additionally, create an additional field to calculate the ratio of the upload speed to the download speed.
- Upload the following file of the system speeds around the time of the attack: [Speed Test File](http://resources/server_speedtest.csv)
- Using the `eval` command, create a field called `ratio` that shows the ratio between the upload and download speeds

- Create a report using the Splunk's `table` command to display the following fields in a statistics report:
    - `_time`
    - `ip_address`
    - `download_megabits`
    - `upload_megabits`
    - `ratio`

- Based on the report created, what is the approximate date and time of the attack?  **Between 11pm on 22nd to 2pm on February 23rd.**
- How long did it take your systems to recover? **It took the system about 9 hours.**

### Step 3: Are We Vulnerable? 

**Background:**  Due to the frequency of attacks, your manager needs to be sure that sensitive customer data on their servers is not vulnerable. Since Vandalay uses Nessus vulnerability scanners, you have pulled the last 24 hours of scans to see if there are any critical vulnerabilities.

**Task:** Create a report determining how many critical vulnerabilities exist on the customer data server. Then, build an alert to notify your team if a critical vulnerability reappears on this server.

- Upload the following file from the Nessus vulnerability scan - [Nessus Scan Results](http://resources/nessus_logs.csv)
- Create a report that shows the `count` of critical vulnerabilities from the customer database server.
  - The database server IP is `10.11.36.23`.
  - The field that identifies the level of vulnerabilities is `severity`.

- Build an alert that monitors every day to see if this server has any critical vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability exists, have an alert emailed to `soc@vandalay.com`.

### Step 4: Drawing the (base)line

**Background:**  A Vandaly server is also experiencing brute force attacks into their administrator account. Management would like you to set up monitoring to notify the SOC team if a brute force attack occurs again.

**Task:** Analyze administrator logs that document a brute force attack. Then, create a baseline of the ordinary amount of administrator bad logins and determine a threshold to indicate if a brute force attack is occurring.

- Upload the administrator login logs - [Admin Logins](http://resources/Administrator_logs.csv)
- When did the brute force attack occur? **It occurred between 8am and 2pm on Feb 21st.**
  - Hints:
    - Look for the `name` field to find failed logins.
    - Note the attack lasted several hours.

- Determine a baseline of normal activity and a threshold that would alert if a brute force attack is occurring. **Baseline 25.**
- Design an alert to check the threshold every hour and email the SOC team at SOC@vandalay.com if triggered.
