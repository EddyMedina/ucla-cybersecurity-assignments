# Linux Systems Administration Homework

### Ensure permissions on sensitive files

Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access:

- **Command to inspect permissions**: ls -l | grep shadow

- **Command to Set Permissions (if needed)**: sudo chmod 600 shadow

Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access:

- **Command to inspect permissions**: ls -l | grep gshadow

- **Command to Set Permissions (if needed)**: sudo chmod 600 gshadow

Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else `read` access only:

- **Command to inspect permissions**: ls -l | grep group

- **Command to Set Permissions (if needed)**: sudo chmod 644 group

Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else `read` access only:

- **Command to inspect permissions**:ls -l | grep passwd

- **Command to set permissions (if needed)**: sudo chmod 644 passwd

#### Create user accounts

Add user accounts `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`

- **Command to add each user account (please include all 5)**:
  - sudo adduser sam
  - sudo adduser joe
  - sudo adduser amy
  - sudo adduser sara
  - sudo adduser admin

Force users to create 16 character passwords incorporating numbers and symbols

- **Command to edit `pwquality.conf` file**: sudo nano security/pwquality.conf

- **Updates to configuration file**: 
  - minlen = 16
  - dcredit = 1
  - ocredit = 1

Force passwords to expire every 90 days:

- **Command to to set each new user's password to expire in 90 days (please include all 5)**: 
  - sudo chage -M 90 sam
  - sudo chage -M 90 joe
  - sudo chage -M 90 amy
  - sudo chage -M 90 sara
  - sudo chage -M 90 admin

Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access:

- **Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group**: sudo usermod -aG sudo admin
  - verify with: groups admin

#### Create user group and collaborative folder

Add a `engineers` group to the system.

- **Command**: sudo addgroup engineers

Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group

- **Command to add users to `engineers` group (please include all 4)**:
  - sudo usermod -aG engineers sam
  - sudo usermod -aG engineers joe
  - sudo usermod -aG engineers amy
  - sudo usermod -aG engineers sara

- Verify with: tail group

Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`

- **Command to create the shared folder**: sudo mkdir /home/engineers

Change the group on the engineers directory to the `engineers` group

- **Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group**: sudo chgrp engineers /home/engineers/

Add the `SGID` bit and the `sticky` bit to allow collaboration between engineers in this directory

- **Command to set SGID and sticky bit to shared folder**: sudo chmod o+t,g+s /home/engineers

#### Lynis auditing

Install and run `lynis`

- **Command to install `lynis`:** sudo apt install lynis

- **Command to see options:** man lynis

- **Command to run an audit:** sudo lynis audit system

Provide a report from `lynis` output on what more could be done to harden the system.
