# Week 9 - Networks Fundamentals II
## Your Objectives:
- Review each network issue in the missions below.
- Document each DNS record type found.
- Take note of the DNS records that can explain the reasons for the existing network issue.
- Provide recommended fixes to save the Galaxy!
## Mission 1
Determine and document the mail servers for starwars.com using NSLOOKUP.
```bash
cristina@kali:~$ nslookup -type=mx starwars.com
Server:         172.16.64.2
Address:        172.16.64.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
starwars.com    mail exchanger = 10 aspmx3.googlemail.com.
starwars.com    mail exchanger = 5 alt1.aspx.l.google.com.
starwars.com    mail exchanger = 10 aspmx2.googlemail.com.
starwars.com    mail exchanger = 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
starwars.com    mail exchanger = 1 aspmx.l.google.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```
Explain why the Resistance isn't receiving any emails.
- The Resistance isn't receiving any emails because the new mail servers have not been added: **asltx.l.google.com** and **asltx.2.google.com**.
Document what a corrected DNS record should be.
- A corrected DNS record will include **asltx.l.google.com** and **asltx.2.google.com** in the mail servers.
## Mission 2
Determine and document the SPF for theforce.net using NSLOOKUP.
```bash
cristina@kali:~$ nslookup -type=txt theforce.net
Server:         172.16.64.2
Address:        172.16.64.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
theforce.net    text = "google-site-verification=XTU_We07Cux-6WCSOItl0c_WS29hzo92jPE341ckbOQ"
theforce.net    text = "google-site-verification=ycgY7mtk2oUZMagcffhFL_Qaf8Lc9tMRkZZSuig0d6w"
theforce.net    text = "v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215"

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```
Explain why the Force's emails are going to spam.
- The IP address **45.23.176.21** isn't showing in the authorized senders section 
Document what a corrected DNS record should be.
- A corrected DNS record will include **45.23.176.21** in the SPF:
```bash
cristina@kali:~$ nslookup -type=txt theforce.net
Server:         172.16.64.2
Address:        172.16.64.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
theforce.net    text = "google-site-verification=XTU_We07Cux-6WCSOItl0c_WS29hzo92jPE341ckbOQ"
theforce.net    text = "google-site-verification=ycgY7mtk2oUZMagcffhFL_Qaf8Lc9tMRkZZSuig0d6w"
theforce.net    text = "v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215 ip4:45.23.176.21"

Authoritative answers can be found from:

## Mission 3
Document how a CNAME should look by viewing the CNAME of www.theforce.net using NSLOOKUP.
```bash
cristina@kali:~$ nslookup -type=cname www.theforce.net
Server:         172.16.64.2
Address:        172.16.64.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
www.theforce.net        canonical name = theforce.net.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```
Explain why the sub page of resistance.theforce.net isn't redirecting to www.theforce.net.
- The CNAME is not configured to include **resistance.theforce.net** as a redirect.
Document what a corrected DNS record should be.
- A corrected DNS record will include **resistance.theforce.net** in the CNAME redirect:
```bash
cristina@kali:~$ nslookup -type=cname www.theforce.net
Server:         172.16.64.2
Address:        172.16.64.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
www.theforce.net        canonical name = theforce.net.
resistance.theforce.net        canonical name = theforce.net.

Authoritative answers can be found from:

## Mission 4
Confirm the DNS records for princessleia.site.
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ sudo nslookup -type=ns princessleia.site
Server:         172.16.64.2
Address:        172.16.64.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
princessleia.site       nameserver = ns25.domaincontrol.com.
princessleia.site       nameserver = ns26.domaincontrol.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```
Document how you would fix the DNS record to prevent this issue from happening again.
- I would add **ns2.galaxybackup.com** as a name server:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ sudo nslookup -type=ns princessleia.site
Server:         172.16.64.2
Address:        172.16.64.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
princessleia.site       nameserver = ns25.domaincontrol.com.
princessleia.site       nameserver = ns26.domaincontrol.com.
princessleia.site       nameserver = ns2.galaxybackup.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:

## Mission 5
View the Galaxy Network Map and determine the OSPF shortest path from Batuu to Jedha.
- Batuu -> D -> C -> E -> F -> J -> I -> L -> Q -> T -> V -> Jedha (23 hops)
Confirm your path doesn't include Planet N in its route. - Does not include Planet N

## Mission 6
Figure out the Dark Side's secret wireless key by using Aircrack-ng.
- Hint: This is a more challenging encrypted wireless traffic using WPA.
- In order to decrypt, you will need to use a wordlist (-w) such as rockyou.txt.
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ sudo aircrack-ng -w rockyou.txt Darkside.pcap 
[sudo] password for cristina:

Use the Dark Side's key to decrypt the wireless traffic in Wireshark.
- Hint: The format for the key to decrypt wireless is <Wireless_key>:<SSID>.
![Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d1f8ecn0agbpdj9/HJy_9GOaL_S1aeQaY6I.png?dl=1)

Once you have decrypted the traffic, figure out the following Dark Side information:
- Host IP Addresses and MAC Addresses by looking at the decrypted ARP traffic.
  - Host IP Address: **172.16.0.101** 
  - Mac Address: **00:13:ce:55:98:ef**
## Mission 7
View the DNS record from Mission #4.
The Resistance provided you with a hidden message in the TXT record, with several steps to follow:
```bash
cristina@kali:~/Desktop$ sudo nslookup -type=txt princessleia.site
Server:         172.16.64.2
Address:        172.16.64.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
princessleia.site       text = "Run the following in a command line: telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl or as a backup access in a browser: www.asciimation.co.nz"

```
Follow the steps from the TXT record.

Screenshot of the results: STAR WARS!
