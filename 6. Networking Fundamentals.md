# Week 8 - Networking Fundamentals
## Phase 1: "I'd like to Teach the World to Ping"

Determine the IPs for the Hollywood office and run **fping** against the IP ranges in order to determine which IP is accepting connections.

Determined the IP ranges to scan were 15.199.95.91/28, 15.199.94.91/28, 11.199.158.91/28, 167.172.144.11/32, and 11.199.141.91/28
-  Ran **fping** against those addresses using the following command:
```bash
cristina@kali:~$ sudo fping -g 15.199.95.91/28

11.199.141.94 is unreachable
```

After scanning, found that 167.172.144.11 is responding, which is a **vulnerability**. 

**Recommend** that IP 167.172.144.11 restricts allowing their ICMP echo requests in order to prevent successful responses from ping requests. 

OSI Layer: **Layer 3 - Network Layer**

## Phase 2:  "Some Syn for Nothin`"

Ran the nmap command to determine which ports were open. **Port 22** is showing that it's open.

```bash
cristina@kali:~$ sudo nmap -sS 167.172.144.11
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-13 10:33 PDT
Nmap scan report for 167.172.144.11
Host is up (1.8s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 3.12 seconds
```

Port 22 is open, meaning that a hacker can ssh into the server, that presents a **vulnerability**.

**Recommend** closing Port 22 to prevent unauthorized entry.

OSI Layer: **Layer 4 - Transport Refresher**

## Phase 3: "I Feel a DNS Change Comin' On"

Used the command below to ssh into the server, using **jimi** as the username and **hendrix** as the password:

```bash
cristina@kali:~$ sudo ssh jimi@167.172.144.11 -p 22
[sudo] password for cristina: 
jimi@167.172.144.11's password: 
Linux GTscavengerHunt 4.9.0-11-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.9.189-3+deb9u1 (2019-09-20) x86_64

```
Used **ls** to to view the directories and used the command:
```bash
cd etc/
```

Once in the **etc** folder, used the command below to see where rollingstone.com was being redirected to:

```bash
$ cat hosts
# Your system has configured 'manage_etc_hosts' as True.
# As a result, if you wish for changes to this file to persist
# then you will need to either
# a.) make changes to the master file in /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl
# b.) change or remove the value of 'manage_etc_hosts' in
#     /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or cloud-config from user-data
#
127.0.1.1 GTscavengerHunt.localdomain GTscavengerHunt
127.0.0.1 localhost
98.137.246.8 rollingstone.com

oooooooollowing lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
ff02::3 ip6-allhosts

$ pwd
/etc
```

rollingstone.com is redirecting to 98.137.246.8.

Using my local Apple computer, used the command below to determine the real domain of the IP address found for rollingstone.com redirect:
```bash
cristina@Cristinas-Mac-mini ~ % nslookup 98.137.246.8          
Server:		209.18.47.62
Address:	209.18.47.62#53

Non-authoritative answer:
8.246.137.98.in-addr.arpa	name = media-router-fp2.prod1.media.vip.gq1.yahoo.com.

Authoritative answers can be found from:
```

The domain name found was: **media-router-fp2.prod1.media.vip.gq1.yahoo.com**.

The **vulnerability** is that the permissions are not restricted enough, thereby allowing website address redirects.

**Recommendation** includes changing the redirect for the rollingstone.com to the actual website as well as change permissions so that only sudo users can access.

OSI Layer**: Layer 7 - Application - HTTP/FTP, working through Layer 3 - Network Layer**

## Phase 4:  "ShARP Dressed Man"

Used the **cat** command to view the document that the hacker left behind:

```bash
$ cat packetcaptureinfo.txt
 Captured Packets are here:
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ic-CFFGrbruloYrWaw3PvT71elTkh3eF/view?usp=sharing
```

The link led to a pcap file called secretlogs. Opened the file using Wireshark:


![Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gjsqgik5lu4xw73/S1nwCuMp8_r1BG1NBa8.png?dl=1)

Based on my analysis of the secretlog pcap on Wireshark, I have found the following:
- Duplicate IP address detected, meaning a potential ARP spoofing attack - **Vulnerability**

ISO Layer - **Layer 2 - ARP**

Used the following command to show any POST requests: **http.request.method == "POST"**

![Image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kvyz74y0mx54pkl/S1nwCuMp8_rk2LkBSp8.png?dl=1)

The results revealed an email from the hacker. The email shows that the hacker is aware of the open port and is using the login information to scam for money. 

**Recommendation** to do all the recommendations listed in the previous phases and if possible, to list this email as a phishing threat.
